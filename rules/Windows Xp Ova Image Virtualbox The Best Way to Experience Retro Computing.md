# How to Install Windows XP on VirtualBox Using an OVA Image
 
If you want to run Windows XP on a virtual machine, you might have trouble finding a suitable ISO file or a CD-ROM. However, there is another way to install Windows XP on VirtualBox using an OVA image file. An OVA image file is a compressed archive that contains a virtual machine configuration and a disk image. You can import an OVA image file into VirtualBox and start using Windows XP without any additional setup.

## Step 1: Download a Windows XP OVA Image File
 
There are several sources where you can download a Windows XP OVA image file for VirtualBox. Here are some of them:
 
- [GitHub - lucianoferrari/winxpimage](https://github.com/lucianoferrari/winxpimage): This is a clean installation of Windows XP with no additional software or guest additions installed. It was created for students who are learning pentesting and want to follow some penetration testing books like "Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking". The download link is on Google Drive and the file size is about 1.5 GB[^1^].

Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) is a flight simulation video game that was released in October 2006. It is the tenth and most recent installment of the Microsoft Flight Simulator series. FSX features improved graphics, realistic weather effects, and new aircraft models. It also allows players to fly online with other pilots using a multiplayer matchmaking system over the GameSpy network. However, this service was discontinued in December 2012, leaving many players unable to connect with each other. In order to revive the game and its community, Microsoft signed a licensing agreement with Dovetail Games, the developer of Train Simulator, on July 9, 2014. Dovetail Games announced that they would continue to develop FSX and create new content for it.[2] They also released a new version of FSX called FSX: Steam Edition on December 18, 2014. This version is available through digital distribution via Steam, a popular online gaming platform. FSX: Steam Edition includes support for Windows 8.1 and later operating systems, as well as updated hosting of FSX multiplayer features through Steam.[3]
  
FSX: Steam Edition has received mixed reviews from critics and players. Some praised the improved performance, stability, and compatibility of the game, as well as the availability of new content and updates. Others criticized the lack of backward compatibility with some add-ons and mods created for the original FSX, as well as the persistent bugs and glitches that plagued the game. Some also complained about the poor customer service and support from Dovetail Games and Steam.[4]

Despite its flaws, FSX: Steam Edition remains one of the most popular and realistic flight simulation games on the market. It offers a wide range of aircraft to choose from, from small propeller planes to large jets and helicopters. It also features over 24,000 airports and locations around the world, as well as various weather conditions and time of day settings. Players can customize their flights with different missions, challenges, and scenarios, or create their own using the built-in editor. They can also join online sessions with other pilots and controllers, or host their own servers using Steam.[5]

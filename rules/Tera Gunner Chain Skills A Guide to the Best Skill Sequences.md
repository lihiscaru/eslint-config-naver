Chain skills are indicated by a small arrow icon on the skill icon, and can be customized in the Chained Skills menu. However, some chain skills are default and cannot be changed, such as Blast > Rolling Reload > Scattershot. Chain skills can be activated by pressing the spacebar or by using a hotkey. Using chain skills can also generate Willpower, which is a resource that powers some of the Gunner's strongest skills, such as Burst Fire, Bombardment, and Balder's Vengeance.
 
In this article, we will go over some of the most important chain skills for the Gunner class, and how to use them effectively in different situations.
 
## Blast > Rolling Reload > Scattershot
 
This is the basic chain skill for the Gunner, and it should be used frequently to build Willpower and deal damage. Blast is a single shot that explodes on impact or up to 20m away. Rolling Reload is a dodge that eliminates the cooldown for Scattershot. Scattershot is a spread of five penetrating shots that hit enemies within 20m. Each successful hit with Blast or Scattershot generates 20 Willpower, up to a maximum of 100 Willpower per skill.
 
This chain skill is useful for both single-target and AoE damage, as well as for mobility and repositioning. You can use Blast to initiate combat or to finish off low-health enemies. You can use Rolling Reload to avoid enemy attacks or to get closer or farther from your target. You can use Scattershot to hit multiple enemies in front of you or to deal extra damage to a single enemy.

## Arc Bomb > Time Bomb
 
This is another chain skill that can deal AoE damage and crowd control enemies. Arc Bomb is a bomb that can bounce up to three times before exploding, stunning nearby enemies on impact. Time Bomb is a shot that leaves behind a bomb that detonates after two seconds, slowing and blasting enemies into the air. Each successful hit with Arc Bomb or Time Bomb generates 20 Willpower, and the secondary detonation of Time Bomb generates 40 Willpower.
 
This chain skill is useful for interrupting enemy casts or movements, as well as for setting up combos with other skills. You can use Arc Bomb to stun enemies and then follow up with Time Bomb for more damage and knockup. You can also use Time Bomb after other skills that knock up enemies, such as Mana Missiles or Balder's Vengeance, for extra damage and Willpower.
 
## Burst Fire
 
This is not a chain skill per se, but it is one of the most important skills for the Gunner class. Burst Fire is a penetrating shot that affects up to three enemies in a line up to 20m away. It consumes Willpower to fire continuously, and each successive shot has increased damage and crit chance. Enemies hit by Burst Fire are also slowed.
 
This skill is the main source of damage for the Gunner class, and it should be used whenever you have enough Willpower and a clear line of sight to your target. You can use Burst Fire after any skill that generates Willpower, such as Blast, Scattershot, Arc Bomb, Time Bomb, Mana Missiles, or Balder's Vengeance. You can also use Burst Fire after any skill that immobilizes or knocks up enemies, such as Arc Bomb, Time Bomb, Mana Missiles, Balder's Vengeance, or Point Blank.
 
## Conclusion
 
The Gunner class in TERA is a fun and versatile class that can deal massive damage from afar with its arcannon and robot companion. By mastering the chain skills and Willpower management, you can unleash your full potential as a Gunner and dominate the battlefield.
